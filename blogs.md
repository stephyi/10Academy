#### DATASET,FEATURES AND PRE-PROCESSING
The main source of data was from Twitter.After scraping the top 100 most influential usersin Africa and top government officials ​,​I used the twitter API to retrieve tweets for thescraped users as well as other significant metadata eg followers_count,user_mentions etc.Data Preprocessing and Tokenizing is done by:
1. Normalizing all terms to lowercase.
2. using English tokenization rule. 
3. filtering punctuations and emojis. 
4. removingcommon English stop words.


#### ANALYSIS
Determining the:
* Relevance of users
>From analysis the government officials tweets are mostly dominated by politics while the top influencer’s tweets contain >different topics. Hence one of the influencer’s orsomeone in both categories might be a better fit to drive the >campaign.

* Reach
>By calculating the metric we can estimate  how many people will most probably come across the content

* Engagement
>Inorder to view how the influencers interact with their followers,we calculate thenumber of times a user is mentioned in >other tweets as this could imply that thefollowers are replying to or engaging in the influencer’s content.

* Content quality
>This will help the brand produce authentic content which leads to organicconversions.❖By looking into the number of >retweets and likes(,this shows whether otherusers are interested in this user’s  particular content hence implying the >influencer posts content that is useful or resonates with the users.

#### LIMITATIONS

+ Although twitter is a big platform that can be used to drive marketing,it has somefew constraints;Not all influencers on twitter have the same domination on other platforms
+ A brand like Nike flourishes more with video content which might not besuitable for this audience.They should also work on promoting content onother platforms.Also an influencer with significant relevance on otherplatforms is a plus.

+ With the word-limit on twitter,ensure the  content is exceptional,captivatingand outstanding.

#### CONCLUSION
